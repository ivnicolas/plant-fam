# Plant Fam 
This Sinatra Application allows user to sign up and create their own Plant Fam. In it's current state user can sign up with their own information, edit their profile, and create lists for their plants

## Motivation 
I love plants and the energy they bring into spaces. However, I am not always the best at taking care of them and often get overwhelmed when scrolling through google to try and find the information I need. I wanted to build an application where other amateur plant care takers could connect with one another, exchange tips on how to care for simple houseplants, and keep track of their own plants and it's needs. 

## Installation
To test it out, clone down this repo and run:
- `cd plant-fam`
- `bundle install`

To start the CLI app run
- `shotgun`
